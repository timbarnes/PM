======
*keeping private data out of source control and applying DRY principles for resource information since 2009*

YamJam is a multi-project, shared, yaml based configuration system. It is also a mechanism to keep secret/private data from leaking out to source control systems (i.e. git, bitbucket, svn, et al) by factoring out sensitive data from your commits.

* Factor out sensitive data from your Django settings.py file
* Makes install by source control easy by allowing different configs on your dev, staging and production machines
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Resource configuration

Tested on Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
